# Molecule-Design-
Welcome to the Molecule Design Web Application! This application allows you to generate new molecules based on desired properties, predict their toxicity, and find similar molecules.
# Overview
The Molecule Design Web Application is built to provide a user-friendly interface for designing and exploring novel molecules. By inputting specific molecular properties, users can generate new molecules using advanced algorithms and machine learning models. The application then evaluates the toxicity of these generated molecules and provides a list of similar molecules for further exploration.
# Features
Molecule Generation: Input desired molecular properties, such as desired molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or specific functional groups. The application will use sophisticated algorithms and chemical rules to generate new molecules that match the given criteria.

Toxicity Prediction: The application employs a state-of-the-art toxicity prediction model to evaluate the potential toxicity of generated molecules. This helps users identify molecules with favorable safety profiles and prioritize them for further analysis.

Similar Molecule Search: Once molecules are generated, the application allows users to search for similar molecules based on structural similarity or property similarity. This feature aids in finding molecules with similar chemical structures or properties to the generated molecules, facilitating further exploration and analysis.

Visualization and Export: The web application provides interactive visualization tools to explore the generated molecules, view their chemical structures, and examine their properties. Users can also export the generated molecules in various formats, such as SMILES or SDF, for use in external applications or further research.
